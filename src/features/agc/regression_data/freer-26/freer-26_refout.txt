: Mrs. Edward McEntee's recollections of her early childhood days, asrelated to us, contain more accounts of the Indians than therecollections of any other old people with whom we have talked.  Theyprobably remained longer in the locality about Rosendale Plains thanelsewhere in this vicinity.  On the east side of the road was anIndian burying ground.  One of the neighbors attempted to plow it up,but the red men made him stop.  The Indians had bark wigwams scatteredthroughout the woods.  The spot where one  of these had stood would bemarked long after it had disappeared by a patch of tansy, that being afavorite herb of the red men.  She says she saw the Indians many timeswhen a child.  They were kind people if treated well.  In theirwigwams they would lie on the floor with their feet to the fire.Sometimes they would pass the house, the pappooses strapped to theirfather's backs.  The little ones would laugh and call to her.  Whenshe as a young woman she lived at Benjamin Van Wegenen's in thisvillage.  The Indians would come and shoot with bow and arrow atcopper coins at a distance of about fifty yards.  If they hit thepenny they would keep it.  (This was a travelling company).  When shewas a small child an Indian woman would call at the house and delightto play with her, sometimes lifting her up by one arm, but this hermother forbade for fear of injury.  At one time there was a wigwamright by her grandfather's door.  When the first Freer located atBontecoe an Indian set up his wigwam in the clearing.  Sometimes hewould lie drunk on the door-step.  He was not disturbed and after atime went away.
